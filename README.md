# mywebsite

This is my personal website. It uses node.js and expressjs to host the pages. I'm evolving all pages from php I made a couple of years ago and hosting them on AWS. I'm expecting to integrate them all together in a MEAN stack. 

Currently the pages are hosted on [shaopeng.us](http://shaopeng.us). It may be on and off occasionally during the construction. 

~shz25 folder contains old stuff from PITT. Don't ask me what's in there. It's a mistery.
