	Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) will by default ignore
	server-generated error messages when they are "too small"
	and substitute its own "friendly" error messages. The size
	threshold varies depending on the type of error, but in
	general, if you make your error document greater than 512
	bytes, then MSIE will show the server-generated error rather
	than masking it. More information is available in
	Microsoft Knowledgebase article Q294807.
