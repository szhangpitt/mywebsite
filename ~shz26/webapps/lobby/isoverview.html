<h2>About SIS: Overview</h2>
<p>At the School of Information Sciences (SIS), our curriculum and research   activities are focused on people, their information needs, and the technology to   manage such information. It is estimated that the amount of information   available for human use <em>doubles every three years</em>. As society enjoys an   escalating amount of available information, corporations and organizations need   highly trained professionals to manage information and access.</p>
<p>For more than 100 years, SIS has educated students to become leaders in the   information professions. They may work in libraries and archives, companies and   manufacturing industries, or governments and nonprofits. They may work with   books, artifacts, digital documents, routers, networks, or databases. They solve   problems in the boardroom, the operating room, or the schoolroom. They have a   set of skills and the theoretical knowledge to harness the power of this   influential resource, information.</p>
<p>Our school offers degree programs in Information Science, Library and   Information Science, and Telecommunications. Our graduates have the skills and   knowledge to help advance society through effective use and management of   information.</p>
